## Manual Scenario Creation:
  For manual test cases please refer to the sheet: ---> Tradelingassessment test cases.xlsx
   
## Challenges/Limitations:
1. I have hands on experience in Selenium but for this case Study I have to learn Cypress parallel to automate the given scenarios.
2. Amazon security forces to ask for OTP even if existing user is logged in multiple browsers.
3. I did Amazaon scenario automation with existing account as for New account creation in Amazon I was associating gmail account but it rquires gmail api integration. Its an exciting dimension with great challenges so at the moment I am only able to expose gmail api with cypress (Automation is yet to done and I am working on it as I found it an exciting learning opportunity for myself).
